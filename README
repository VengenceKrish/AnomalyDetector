# Network Intrusion Detection System

A machine learning-based intrusion detection system that identifies malicious network traffic using the Random Forest algorithm.

## Overview

This project uses supervised machine learning to classify network connections as either normal traffic or cyber attacks. Trained on the NSL-KDD dataset, the model achieves ~99% accuracy in detecting various types of network intrusions.

## Features

- **Binary Classification**: Distinguishes between normal and malicious network traffic
- **Random Forest Algorithm**: Uses ensemble learning with 50 decision trees
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 98-99% accuracy on test data
- **Multi-Attack Detection**: Trained to recognize 38+ different attack types including:
  - DoS attacks (neptune, smurf, back)
  - Probe attacks (portsweep, ipsweep, nmap)
  - Privilege escalation (buffer_overflow, rootkit)
  - And more

## Dataset

Uses the **NSL-KDD dataset**, an improved version of the KDD Cup '99 dataset:
- 22,544 training samples
- 40+ network traffic features (duration, protocol, bytes transferred, error rates, etc.)
- Balanced representation of normal and attack traffic

## Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas & numpy**: Data manipulation
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development and visualization

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VengenceKrish/AnomalyDetector.git
cd AnomalyDetector

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Download the NSL-KDD dataset and place in `Data/` folder
2. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

## Results

- **Accuracy**: ~98.7%
- **Precision**: 98-99% for both normal and attack traffic
- **Recall**: 99% for both classes
- **F1-Score**: 98-99%
